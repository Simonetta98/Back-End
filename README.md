ðŸ”— INFO <br/>
This repository refers to my Epicode's Full Stack Bootcamp journey, where I had the opportunity to deepen my programming knowledge, learning and exercising everyday,
creating solo projects and group projects. <br/>
ðŸ”— INSIDE <br/>
Exercises aside, inside every week folder there's usually a bigger project that condense all the skills learned during that week.
Every 4th week there's a group project that sums up the skills learned in that month.
